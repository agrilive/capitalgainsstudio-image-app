# Capital Gains Studio Image Classification Project

TechForShe, a women-in-tech empowerment community, partnered with Capital Gains Studio, a Singapore board game designer company, as part of the ImpactMakers 2019 project. 

- Our task: Develop an image classification mobile application of game cards for educational purposes.
- Background: The game cards developed are predominantly in English. However, the company is expanding into Southeast Asia, which does not have English as its main language. It is costly to print cards of multiple languages, especially in a small market. They need a mobile app that could allow users to enjoy their games and learn despite using English cards.

The team consists of four members and two co-leaders. My task in this project was to develop the deep learning model that can identify the image card. I started off using fast.ai pre-trained models as we only had a small dataset of 48 images. This made training a deep learning model from scratch infeasible.
